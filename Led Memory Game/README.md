# Led Memory Game

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create an LED memory game. In this game, there are four LEDs, and the user has to remember the order in which the LEDs turn on. Once the sequence is shown, the user is asked to enter the same order using four push buttons. If they enter the sequence correctly, the game continues and a new LED blinking is added to the sequence. If the user fails, the game restarts with another random sequence. Additionally, there is a buzzer that creates sounds whenever a button is pressed or when the user makes a mistake.
